# Auron Programming Language

Auron is a modern, multi-paradigm programming language designed for efficient web and mobile application development. It aims to provide a seamless experience for creating cross-platform applications with a focus on readability and developer productivity.

## Current Status

Auron is in the early stages of development. We are currently working on the basic language design and implementing core components such as the lexer and parser.

## Features (Planned)

- Multi-paradigm: support for both object-oriented and functional programming
- Strong, static typing with type inference
- Built-in concurrency support
- Native JSON support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Integrated web and mobile development features

## Getting Started

As Auron is still in early development, there isn't a working compiler or interpreter available yet. However, you can follow the project's progress and contribute to its development.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher (for running the current lexer implementation)
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/auron-lang.git
cd auron-lang
```

### Running the Lexer

```bash
python lexer.py
```
